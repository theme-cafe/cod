Cash On Delivery service check extension which enables the COD Payment method if the service is available in particular area.

You can also download this extesnion from magento connect by following the below url:
http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalog/product/view/id/27569/

This extension provides the facility to manage the Cash On Delivery service in particular area. Merchant can add the Area zipcode and COD service status via magneto admin panel. User can check with the availablility of COD service in particular area by zipcode through the form available at product view page and in category page left sidebar. The cash on delivery payment method will be automatically disabled as per the customer shipping address zipcode if the service is not available in that area.

This change has two effects on the behaviour of a Magento site:

Installation

Installation of COD Extension is the same as for most extensions, that is via your Magento Connect Manager using the extension key found on the MagentoCommerce site or directly via package upload if you are having package format. Important: Once installed you must refresh all caches (under System->Cache Management). You will then also need to logout then login of Admin (the COD Admin options will not be displayed otherwise).

There are also some COD configuration options under System->Configuration->THEMECAFE->COD Settings, and it's likely you will want to change these from their default values. What each option does should hopefully be self-explanatory.

Uninstallation

Uninstallation of COD extension is the same as for most extensions, that is via your Magento Connect Manager. Once COD extension is uninstalled you must go into Admin and refresh cache (under System->Cache Management)


Main Features

    Merchant can upload the csv file with zipcodes in which areas cash on delivery service is available. 
    merchant can display COD service check form on product vie page and in left sidebar on category page.
    The cash on delivery payement method will be deactivated if the service is not available in particular area.
    There's no theme setup needed. Just install the extension like any other, refresh your caches, and away you go.
